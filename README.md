## How to run
1. Clone this repository
2. Clone the [front-end repository](https://github.com/issitarual/verzel-challenge-front)
3. Follow instructions to run [front-end](https://github.com/issitarual/verzel-challenge-front)
4. Create a database using the ``dump.sql`` file inside the ``dump``
```bash
cd verzel-challenge-back
uvicorn main:app --reload
```
5. Access [Swagger UI](http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs#/) and create your admin user with POST/users route as the example:
```bash
{
  "email": "string",
  "password": "string",
  "name": "string",
  "isUserAdmin": true
}
```
Obs: The front-end application only creates not admin users. So, if you want to create, delete, or update a car, you'll have to create the user using the [Swagger UI](http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs#/) or another Rest API Client.
